# 🍵 YouTube/Facebook/Instagram Video Downloader Discord Bot 🍵

I made this code in Python that allows you to download videos from Facebook Reels, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts using your own discord bot. simply by sending a video link in your Discord channel. The bot will fetch and send the downloaded video directly in the channel for you. It is very helpful if you are scrolling through reels and wanting to share the video to your discord friends directly, rather than having to use the websites to download videos that sometimes comes with ads and it is very hassle and annoying.
